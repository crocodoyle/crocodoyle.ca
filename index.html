	    <h2>About</h2>
	  
	    <p>
	    I'm a software developer at the <a href="http://mcin-cnim.ca/">McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (MCIN)</a> working on tools to support neuroscience research.
	    I have always been interested in how the brain works, and during my DEC in Liberal Arts in 2005, I gave my final seminar on Artificial Intelligence and training Multi-Level Perceptrons in 2005.
	    I did a Master's degree at McGill University in the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~pvg/">Probabilistic Vision Group</a> (and remade the website), and my thesis focused
	    on building computer vision models in MRI images for Multiple Sclerosis patients to predict the natural course of the disease. I now spend my free time investigating deep learning
	    models to solve problems in neuroimaging.

	      I captain an ultimate frisbee team year-round, canoe-trip, hike, and play tennis in the summer, and ski and play hockey in the winter. I play the flute, bass, and the piano.

	      I like brains, and I 3D-print them in my spare time. My brain can be found below. The surface reconstruction was done using CIVET 2.0, and the visualization is done using the <a href="https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/">BrainBrowser</a> Surface Viewer.

	      And here's a photo of my 3D-printed brain. This is the first one I did at 50% scale. It looks small, but all the neuroscientists tell me it's the connections that count! And the cortical thickness.

	    <p>
	      I have worked extensively using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, using Grails at the National Film Board to manage and automate the digitization and archival of film reels.
		  I dabbled with Django when I learned Python during my Master's, and made a little prototype of a <a href="https://github.com/crocodoyle/growr">medical growth chart app</a>.
		  For my work at MCIN I use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, primarily for a project called <a href="https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/"> CBRAIN</a>, which is all <a href="https://github.com/aces/cbrain">open source</a>.
